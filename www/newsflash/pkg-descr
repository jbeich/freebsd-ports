NewsFlash is a program designed to complement an already existing
web-based RSS reader account. It combines all the advantages of web
based services like syncing across all your devices with everything
you expect from a modern desktop program: Desktop notifications, fast
search and filtering, tagging, handy keyboard shortcuts and having
access to all your articles as long as you like.
