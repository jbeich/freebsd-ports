inotify_init1() is wrapped as a file-like object, INotify(), holding
the inotify file descriptor. INotify().read() reads available data
from the file descriptor and returns events as namedtuple objects
after unpacking them with the struct module. inotify_add_watch() and
inotify_rm_watch() are wrapped with no changes at all, taking and
returning watch descriptor integers that calling code is expected to
keep track of itself, just as one would use inotify from C.
