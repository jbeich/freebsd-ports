I have been using sway since 2019 and find it the most comfortable
working environment, but...  Have you ever missed all the graphical
bells and whistles in your panel, we used to have in tint2? It happens
to me.  That's why I decided to try to code a GTK-based panel,
including best features from my two favourites: Waybar and tint2. Many
thanks to Developers and Contributors of the both projects!

There are 8 modules available at the moment, and I don't plan on many
more. Basis system controls are available in the Controls module, and
whatever else you may need, there's an executor for that.
