This project aims to improve upon sway/i3wm features as a plugin for
the Wayfire compositor.

Currently, Swayfire implements most tiling features, optional
decorations, and mouse resizing and moving of windows/tiled parents.

NOTE: Swayfire is currently still in early development and not meant
to be used yet.
