greetd is a minimal and flexible login manager daemon that makes no
assumptions about what you want to launch.

Use gtkgreet to launch sway if you want a fully graphical session, or
use agreety to launch a shell if you want a drop-in replacement for
agetty(8) and login(1).

If you can run it from your shell in a TTY, greetd can start it. If it
can be taught to speak a simple JSON-based IPC protocol, then it can
be a greeter.
